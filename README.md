# Classification techniques and NLP for NDSC FEB 2019
## Project for NLP Feb 2019  
Special thing about my method that MIGHT BE most different other than those basic cleaning is I first partitioned the dataset into the 3 subcategories "Beauty", "fashion" and "mobile" before i do the NLP on each category separately. Do this step for both the train set and test set.  

For each of the set, i eventually choose SGD classifier on each subgroup to get the predicted column.
